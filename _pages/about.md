I am a PhD Candidate at the [Asian Institute of Digital Finance (AIDF)](https://www.aidf.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore, specializing in **Empirical Asset Pricing** and **Machine Learning**.

My research integrates **Demand System Asset Pricing (DSAP)** and **high-dimensional statistical methods** to revisit foundational empirical topics in finance.
